# Rememberable Password Generator

Most password generators make passwords that are just a bunch of symbols nobody would remeber. But with this password generator made with Python and JSON, you can make a
password that isn't just a bunch of symbols but is also easy to remember and has all the requirements needed for a strong password. All you do is type in how many
passwords you want to generate and then the amount of passwords you wanted generated will be made for you.
